# Text Sentiment API
This is a portfolio project I made to show how I am able to create API services and integrate Artificial Intelligence into projects.

## Technical Skills
### Concepts
* API endpoint creation
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN) TSraining
* Word Vectorization
* Saving models and vectorization parameters in external files to save time training
* Integrating AI models into API services

### Frameworks and Tools
* Tensorflow for the ANN
* Scikit-Learn for the word vectorizer
* Pickle to save and use the vectorization parameters
* FastAPI for API endpoints

## In simpler terms..
I am able to create API services and create and integrate AI models into my projects, resulting in products similar to OpenAI's API for ChatGPT and Google's API for Gemini.
